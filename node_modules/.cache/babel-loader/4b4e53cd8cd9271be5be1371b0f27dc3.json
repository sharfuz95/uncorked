He started\n                                        his own venture at school where he fixed people's computers,\n                                        rode a Harley Davidson and ate too much Chipotle(update:he\n                                        still does). He didn't want to force himself just to be a\n                                        software engineer(unlike many) and crafted his career as a\n                                        Sales Engineer at Cisco. Unlike convention, it took him 6\n                                        years to finish college, but unlike many he hacked his way\n                                        to finding his passion and what he is good at.\n                </p>\n                                    <div className=\"social\">\n                                        <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-basta-1064b589/\" target=\"_blank\"><i\n                                            className=\"icofont-linkedin\"></i></a>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch\">\n                            <div className=\"member\">\n                                <img src={require(\"../img/trainers/Aliye.png\")} className=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\" />\n                                <div className=\"member-content\">\n                                    <h4>Aliye Gallagher</h4>\n                                    <span>Digital Strategy Advisor</span>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Aliye graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019 with an interdepartmental degree in Digital\n                                        Communications: Theory, Analysis, Practice.
