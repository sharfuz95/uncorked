                  Sid is a graduate from U Rochester where he started a entrepreneurship club, was a senator, failed a class,
                  struggled with getting jobs and also graduated with High Distinction. He hustled his way to Deloitte,
                  Accenture and now is at TCS. Before founding this website that you are reading this in, he ran his
                  professional consulting company where he helped 40+ students get closer to their dream (or any) job.

                  <span>Sales Engineer at Cisco</span>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Sharfuz & Sid, Evan didn't fail a class, he failed
                    multiple. He also graduated from U Rochester (they so didn't
                    meet each other at school) where he was at a music school
                    first for some reason before switching to CSC. He started
                    his own venture at school where he fixed people's computers,
                    rode a Harley Davidson and ate too much Chipotle(update:he
                    still does). He didn't want to force himself just to be a
                    software engineer(unlike many) and crafted his career as a
                    Sales Engineer at Cisco. Unlike convention, it took him 6
                    years to finish college, but unlike many he hacked his way
                    to finding his passion and what he is good at.

                  <span>Solutions Engineer at Ring Central</span>
                  <p>
                    Rhythm graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019
                    with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. He
                    came to the United States 5 years ago for college. During
                    the past 5 years he studied abroad in the United Kingdom and
                    Hong Kong. Having lived in different cities around the world
                    taught him how to adapt in new, unknown and sometimes even
                    unwanted situations. Currently He is living in Denver, CO
                    among the Rocky Mountains and working as an Associate
                    Solutions Engineer at RingCentral, Inc. In his free time, he
                    like to play the guitar and explore the Rocky mountains
                    surrounding Denver.

                    Lauren is a rising senior at Loyola Marymount University,
                    with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business
                    Administration. On campus, she serves as President to the
                    LMU chapter the the Society Women Engineers. She spent her
                    whole life growing up in the Silicon Valley of the Bay Area,
                    only to find herself there again as an intern at Google.
                    After two summers interning at Google, she accepted an offer
                    to be a Software Engineering Intern at the Walt Disney
                    company, which ended up being cancelled due to COVID-19.
                    Luckily, she is now spending her summer as a Software
                    Engineering intern at SAP!

                    Grace is an Executive search consultant and a Community
                    Champion. She used her leadership skills to navigate new
                    industries, new roles, and new goals. Beginning in aerospace
                    and defense manufacturing, she sought out more personally
                    meaningful opportunities as part of a nonprofit team that
                    helped middle and high school students start their own
                    businesses. Ultimately, she found her passion aligned best
                    with human resources where she could blend her industry
                    knowledge with her desire to help others. She has a wealth

                  <span>Business Analyst @ Deloitte</span>
                  <p>
                    Beatriz is a University of Rochester ’19 graduate who is
                    currently working in consulting as a Business Analyst at
                    Deloitte. She is an international student from Spain who
                    wanted to make the most out of her college experience in the
                    US. Hell yeah she did! She decorated her college experience
                    with excellence in academia, research, & campus involvement.
                    She was an Economics and Political Science double major with
                    a double minor in Chinese and International Relations ,
                    completed an honors thesis, and was heavily involved with
                    leadership roles in Student Government. Most notably, she
                    made an everlasting contribution to the UR community through
                    extended leadership as a Senator, and in her senior year, as
                    the President of the UR Student Government. If you were a
                    student at UR while she was in college, you definitely saw
                    her smiling face on campus and she had a positive impact in
                    your college experience in some way. She is an awesome
                    person, can rock out to Spanish music better than anyone
                    else, and we are all convinced by now that she is the
                    embodiment of Meliora.

                    came with the website and we can't figure out how to get rid
                    of him...but we think he is someone who will became an APM
                    at Google upon graduation, after being a summer intern at
                    McKinsey, which he did the summer after he sold his company
                    for Millions, a company that was inspired by his freshman
                    year software engineering internship at Facebook. What do
                    you think?
