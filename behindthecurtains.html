                    reading this in, he ran his professional consulting company
                    where he helped 40+ students get closer to their dream (or

                  <span> Digital Strategy Advisor</span>
                  <p>
                    Aliye loves emails. So much so, that she created an entire
                    degree all about email communications! Not really. Aliye
                    graduated in 2019 with an interdepartmental (aka DIY) degree
                    in Digital Communications: Theory, Analysis, Practice. She
                    continued on to California, joining 16 others in the first
                    cohort of Experience Lab at UC Berkeley. Aliye is a strong
                    advocate for alternative educational paths, experiential
                    learning (clearly) and making it up as you go along. She
                    founded and runs a photo and video business for the past six
                    years, which has now expanded into a digital strategy, web
                    design and development, and many forms of digital art firm.
                    Aliye has worked in London and Dublin, and is always looking
                    around the corner for the next opportunity (her dad calls it
                    the 'jedi mind trick').

                  <h4>Michelle Shuai</h4>
                  <span> Editor & Writer</span>
                  <p>
                    Michelle is a rising sophomore at U Rochester from Honolulu,
                    Hawaii. She currently envisions herself as an Economics
                    major, but because she also has many other interests, she
                    re-thinks her academic plan very often. In her first year at
                    UR, Michelle has been the deputy chair of a Student
                    Government committee, a flutist in Wind Symphony, and an
                    editor at the Campus Times. In her spare time, Michelle goes
                    on hikes to make up for the excessive amounts of milk tea
                    and boba she consumes.

                  <span>Chief Mascot Officer</span>
                  <p>
                    Unlike the rest of us Will is just here for the show. He
                    came with the website and we can't figure out how to get rid
                    of him...but we think he is someone who will became an APM
                    at Google upon graduation, after being a summer intern at
                    McKinsey, which he did the summer after he sold his company
                    for Millions, a company that was inspired by his freshman
                    year software engineering internship at Facebook. What do
                    you think?
