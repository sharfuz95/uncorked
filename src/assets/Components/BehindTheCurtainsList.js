                                        Aliye loves emails. So much so, that she created an entire
                                        degree all about email communications! Not really. Aliye
                                        graduated in 2019 with an interdepartmental (aka DIY) degree
                                        in Digital Communications: Theory, Analysis, Practice. She
                                        continued on to California, joining 16 others in the first
                                        cohort of Experience Lab at UC Berkeley. Aliye is a strong
                                        advocate for alternative educational paths, experiential
                                        learning (clearly) and making it up as you go along. She
                                        founded and runs a photo and video business for the past six
                                        years, which has now expanded into a digital strategy, web
                                        design and development, and many forms of digital art firm.
                                        Aliye has worked in London and Dublin, and is always looking
                                        around the corner for the next opportunity (her dad calls it
                                        the 'jedi mind trick').

                                        major, but because she also has many other interests, she
                                        re-thinks her academic plan very often. In her first year at

                                        on hikes to make up for the excessive amounts of milk tea
                                        and boba she consumes.

                                        Unlike the rest of us Will is just here for the show. He
                                        came with the website and we can't figure out how to get rid
                                        of him...but we think he is someone who will became an APM
                                        at Google upon graduation, after being a summer intern at
                                        McKinsey, which he did the summer after he sold his company
                                        for Millions, a company that was inspired by his freshman
                                        year software engineering internship at Facebook. What do
                                        you think?
