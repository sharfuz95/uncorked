                                    We know finding jobs is hard, always has been, we know because
                                    we went through it too. Covid19 isnâ€™t making it any easier.
                                    Current resources alone aren't enough and that thought
                                    inspired us to tell our stories and create a platform where
                                    you can tell yours and find help. Learn from us. We are not
                                    here to simply say we will get you a job. We are here to share
                                    with you our stories. So that you have the resources to get
                                    the next job and one after. Take you to a place where you can
                                    help yourself without our help.
