                                        Tolga graduated from the University of Rochester in 2020 after pursuing a degree in Electrical &
                                        Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. He spent his time in Rochester researching digital and
                                        image processing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, machine hearing, data mining,
                                        and machine learning. Despite its rigors, he was fascinated with the amount of information carryover
                                        between these fields, and how they complemented or inspired research in one another. He spent his
                                        summer in 2019 doing ML at Qualcomm and is presently a computer vision software engineer at Google!

                                        If you are a student at University of Rochester, you will see a smiling approachable face every now
                                        and then on campus, especially at Career Center events. That’s none other than Joe Testani, the
                                        Assistant Dean & Executive Director of Gwen M. Greene Center for Career Education + Connections of the
                                        University of Rochester. He has spent a good portion of his career advocating for students and the
                                        value of career education within higher education and, more recently, the future of work and how our
                                        communities will be impacted by future generations of workers. He believes career education can serve
                                        as a nexus for an ecosystem that includes students, universities + colleges, our communities (local,
                                        regional and international), and those that seek to hire talent. He leads a team of 22 staff in a

                                        the challenges that life throws around and develop a mindset

                                        or breakdancing!

                                    <p>
                                        Beatriz is a University of Rochester ’19 graduate who is
                                        currently working in consulting as a Business Analyst at
                                        Deloitte. She is an international student from Spain who
                                        wanted to make the most out of her college experience in the
                                        US. Hell yeah she did! She decorated her college experience
                                        with excellence in academia, research, & campus involvement.
                                        She was an Economics and Political Science double major with
                                        a double minor in Chinese and International Relations ,
                                        completed an honors thesis, and was heavily involved with
                                        leadership roles in Student Government. Most notably, she
                                        made an everlasting contribution to the UR community through
                                        extended leadership as a Senator, and in her senior year, as
                                        the President of the UR Student Government. If you were a
                                        student at UR while she was in college, you definitely saw
                                        her smiling face on campus and she had a positive impact in
                                        your college experience in some way. She is an awesome
                                        person, can rock out to Spanish music better than anyone
                                        else, and we are all convinced by now that she is the
                                        embodiment of Meliora.

                                        industries, new roles, and new goals. Beginning in aerospace
                                        and defense manufacturing, she sought out more personally
                                        meaningful opportunities as part of a nonprofit team that
                                        helped middle and high school students start their own

                                        with human resources where she could blend her industry
                                        knowledge with her desire to help others. She has a wealth
                                        of experience and industry knowledge of the recruitment

                                        After two summers interning at Google, she accepted an offer

                                        multiple. He also graduated from U Rochester (they so didn't
                                        meet each other at school) where he was at a music school
                                        first for some reason before switching to CSC. He started
                                        his own venture at school where he fixed people's computers,
                                        rode a Harley Davidson and ate too much Chipotle(update:he
                                        still does). He didn't want to force himself just to be a
                                        software engineer(unlike many) and crafted his career as a
                                        Sales Engineer at Cisco. Unlike convention, it took him 6
                                        years to finish college, but unlike many he hacked his way
                                        to finding his passion and what he is good at.

                                    <p>
                                        Aliye graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019 with an interdepartmental degree in Digital
                                        Communications: Theory, Analysis, Practice. She continued on to California, joining 16 others in the
                                        first cohort of Experience Lab at UC Berkeley. Aliye is a strong advocate for alternative educational
                                        paths, experiential learning (clearly), and making it up as you go along. She founded and runs a photo
                                        and video business for the past six years, which has now expanded into a digital strategy, web design
                                        and development, and many forms of the digital art firm.
