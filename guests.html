                <p>
                  If you are a student at University of Rochester, you will see a smiling approachable face every now
                  and then on campus, especially at Career Center events. Thatâ€™s none other than Joe Testani, the
                  Assistant Dean & Executive Director of Gwen M. Greene Center for Career Education + Connections of the
                  University of Rochester. He has spent a good portion of his career advocating for students and the
                  value of career education within higher education and, more recently, the future of work and how our
                  communities will be impacted by future generations of workers. He believes career education can serve
                  as a nexus for an ecosystem that includes students, universities + colleges, our communities (local,
                  regional and international), and those that seek to hire talent. He leads a team of 22 staff in a
                  re-envisioned effort to serve students and prepare UR for the Future of Work.

                <h4>Beatriz Gil</h4>
                <span>Business Analyst @ Deloitte</span>
                <p>
                  Beatriz is a University of Rochester â€™19 graduate who is
                  currently working in consulting as a Business Analyst at
                  Deloitte. She is an international student from Spain who
                  wanted to make the most out of her college experience in the
                  US. Hell yeah she did! She decorated her college experience
                  with excellence in academia, research, & campus involvement.
                  She was an Economics and Political Science double major with
                  a double minor in Chinese and International Relations ,
                  completed an honors thesis, and was heavily involved with
                  leadership roles in Student Government. Most notably, she
                  made an everlasting contribution to the UR community through
                  extended leadership as a Senator, and in her senior year, as
                  the President of the UR Student Government. If you were a
                  student at UR while she was in college, you definitely saw
                  her smiling face on campus and she had a positive impact in
                  your college experience in some way. She is an awesome
                  person, can rock out to Spanish music better than anyone
                  else, and we are all convinced by now that she is the
                  embodiment of Meliora.

                <h4>Grace Czechowski</h4>
                <span>Executive Search Consultant @ Adecco Search</span>
                <p>
                  Grace is an Executive search consultant and a Community
                  Champion. She used her leadership skills to navigate new
                  industries, new roles, and new goals. Beginning in aerospace
                  and defense manufacturing, she sought out more personally
                  meaningful opportunities as part of a nonprofit team that
                  helped middle and high school students start their own
                  businesses. Ultimately, she found her passion aligned best
                  with human resources where she could blend her industry
                  knowledge with her desire to help others. She has a wealth
                  of experience and industry knowledge of the recruitment
                  world.

                <p>
                  Lauren is a rising senior at Loyola Marymount University,
                  with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business
                  Administration. On campus, she serves as President to the
                  LMU chapter the the Society Women Engineers. She spent her
                  whole life growing up in the Silicon Valley of the Bay Area,
                  only to find herself there again as an intern at Google.
                  After two summers interning at Google, she accepted an offer
                  to be a Software Engineering Intern at the Walt Disney
                  company, which ended up being cancelled due to COVID-19.
                  Luckily, she is now spending her summer as a Software
                  Engineering intern at SAP!

                <span>Solutions Engineer at Ring Central</span>
                <p>
                  Rhythm graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019
                  with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. He
                  came to the United States 5 years ago for college. During
                  the past 5 years he studied abroad in the United Kingdom and
                  Hong Kong. Having lived in different cities around the world
                  taught him how to adapt in new, unknown and sometimes even
                  unwanted situations. Currently He is living in Denver, CO
                  among the Rocky Mountains and working as an Associate
                  Solutions Engineer at RingCentral, Inc. In his free time, he
                  like to play the guitar and explore the Rocky mountains
                  surrounding Denver.

                <span>Sales Engineer at Cisco</span>
                <p>
                  Unlike Sharfuz & Sid, Evan didn't fail a class, he failed
                  multiple. He also graduated from U Rochester (they so didn't
                  meet each other at school) where he was at a music school
                  first for some reason before switching to CSC. He started
                  his own venture at school where he fixed people's computers,
                  rode a Harley Davidson and ate too much Chipotle(update:he
                  still does). He didn't want to force himself just to be a
                  software engineer(unlike many) and crafted his career as a
                  Sales Engineer at Cisco. Unlike convention, it took him 6
                  years to finish college, but unlike many he hacked his way
                  to finding his passion and what he is good at.

                  and video business for the past six years, which has now expanded into a digital strategy, web design
